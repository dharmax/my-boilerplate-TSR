1. This is a work in progress
2. It is meant to be my personal boilerplate for web-apps based on
    * webpack
    * react
    * typescript
    * less
3. Philosophy:
  * be lean and simple
  * use a small set of the best components
  * use strict typing when it brings value; don't over do it though
